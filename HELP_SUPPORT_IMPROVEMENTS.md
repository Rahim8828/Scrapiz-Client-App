# Help & Support Section - Bug Fixes & Improvements

## Overview
Complete overhaul of the Help & Support section with bug fixes, enhanced functionality, better UX, and more comprehensive support options.

## Implementation Date
December 2024

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Missing Error Handling for Contact Methods**
**Problem:** When clicking phone/email links, if the device couldn't open the app, it would fail silently with no user feedback.

**Fix:** 
- Added `Linking.canOpenURL()` check before attempting to open
- Added try-catch error handling
- Shows user-friendly alerts when links can't be opened
- Provides alternative contact methods in error messages

**Code:**
```typescript
try {
  const canOpen = await Linking.canOpenURL(url);
  if (canOpen) {
    await Linking.openURL(url);
  } else {
    Alert.alert('Unable to Open', 'Please install the required app');
  }
} catch (error) {
  Alert.alert('Error', 'Please try alternative contact method');
}
```

### 2. ❌ **Contradictory Information - 24/7 vs Business Hours**
**Problem:** Emergency section said "24/7 helpline" but contact hours showed "9 AM - 6 PM, Mon-Sat" - confusing for users.

**Fix:**
- Changed emergency card text to accurate business hours
- Updated button text from "Call Emergency Support" to "Call Support Now"
- Clarified: "For urgent issues during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)"

**Before:**
```
"For urgent issues or emergencies, please call our 24/7 helpline"
```

**After:**
```
"For urgent issues during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM), call our support team"
```

### 3. ❌ **Static FAQ Section - Not Interactive**
**Problem:** All FAQ answers were always visible, making the section cluttered and hard to scan.

**Fix:**

- Only one answer visible at a time

**Features:**
- Tap question to expand answer

**Fix:**
- User Guide: Shows comprehensive guide overview with email option
- Changed second button to "Submit Feedback" with multiple options
- Both buttons now have meaningful, actionable functionality

### 6. ❌ **Limited FAQ Content**
**Problem:** Only 5 basic FAQs with short, incomplete answers.

**Fix:**
