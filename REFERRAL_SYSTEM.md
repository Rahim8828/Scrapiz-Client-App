# 🎁 Scrapiz Referral System

## Overview
A cost-effective, bootstrapped startup-friendly referral program that incentivizes user growth while maintaining financial sustainability. The referral wallet provides bonus money that gets ADDED to the customer's scrap payout.

## 💰 Referral Economics

### Reward Structure
- **Referrer earns:** ₹10 per successful referral
- **Referee gets:** ₹10 bonus on first order
- **Minimum order value:** ₹500 for referee's first booking

### Why ₹10?
As a bootstrapped startup without external funding, we've designed this system to be:
1. **Sustainable** - Cost-effective for our limited budget
2. **Valuable** - Still meaningful enough to encourage referrals
3. **Win-Win-Win** - Referrer earns, referee saves, environment benefits
4. **Balanced** - Reduced from ₹20 to ₹10 for better sustainability

## 🔄 How It Works

### Step 1: User Shares Code
- Each user gets a unique referral code (e.g., SCRAPIZ2024)
- Can share via WhatsApp, SMS, social media
- Personalized referral link: `https://scrapiz.in/ref/[code]`

### Step 2: Friend Signs Up & Books
- New user signs up using referral code during registration
- **Referral code input field** available on signup page (optional)
- Books first scrap pickup worth minimum ₹500
- Code can be entered during signup or first booking

### Step 3: Rewards Distribution
- **After successful pickup verification:**
  - Referrer: ₹10 added to referral wallet
  - Referee: ₹10 bonus added to their payout

## 💳 Referral Wallet System

### Balance Types
1. **Available Balance**
   - Money already verified and ready to use
   - Can be applied during booking to increase payout

2. **Pending Balance**
   - Awaiting pickup verification
   - Typically clears within 24-48 hours after pickup

### Wallet Usage Feature
- **Toggle-based application** in Step 4 (Order Summary)
- User decides when to use referral balance
- When enabled:
  - Referral bonus ADDS to scrap payout
  - Used amount deducted from wallet
  - Example: ₹100 scrap + ₹100 wallet = ₹200 total payout

- ✓ ₹10 per successful referral
- ✓ Valid for genuine referrals only

- ✓ Must be new to Scrapiz
- ✓ Use referral code during signup

- ✓ Pickup must be successfully completed
- ✓ ₹10 bonus added to payout

### Verification Process

5. ₹10 credited to referrer's wallet
6. Referee gets ₹10 bonus on their payout

## 💡 Business Logic

### Cost-Effectiveness
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** ₹20 per new customer (₹10 + ₹10)
- **Average Order Value:** ₹800-1200
- **Minimum Order Requirement:** ₹500 (filters serious users)
- **ROI:** Positive from first order itself
- **50% reduction in referral cost** for better sustainability

### Important: Payment Flow
**Scrapiz pays customers, customers don't pay us!**
- Customer sells scrap → We pay them
- Referral wallet bonus → ADDS to their payout
- Example: ₹100 scrap + ₹100 wallet = ₹200 received by customer
- NOT a discount system - it's a bonus payment system

### Fraud Prevention
- Minimum order requirement (₹500)
- Verification after successful pickup
- Genuine user validation
- No cash payout (wallet credits only)

### Growth Strategy
- Word-of-mouth marketing
- Viral coefficient potential
- User-driven acquisition
- Low-cost scaling

  - Consistent typography
  - Attention to detail

### Brand Integration

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Order Data Structure
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  items: any[];
  totalAmount: number;
  referralBonus?: number;      // NEW: Bonus amount applied
  finalAmount?: number;         // NEW: Total including bonus
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Step 4 Integration (Sell Tab)
When user reaches Step 4 (Order Summary):
1. Display referral wallet card with balance
2. Toggle switch to enable/disable wallet usage
3. Calculate bonus: `Math.min(walletBalance, totalAmount)`
4. Display breakdown:
   - Estimated Value: ₹100
   - Referral Bonus: +₹100
   - Total Payout: ₹200

### Order Creation Flow
```typescript
handleOrderSubmission() {
  const referralAmount = useReferralBalance ? getReferralDiscount() : 0;
  
  newOrder = {
    items,
    totalAmount,
    referralBonus: referralAmount > 0 ? referralAmount : undefined,
    finalAmount: referralAmount > 0 ? getFinalAmount() : undefined
  };
  
  // Deduct from wallet if used
  if (referralAmount > 0) {
    setWalletBalance(walletBalance - referralAmount);
  }
}
```

### Context Management
```typescript
// ReferralContext.tsx
const ReferralContext = createContext({
  walletBalance: 120,
  pendingBalance: 40,
  totalReferrals: 6,
  successfulReferrals: 6,
  applyReferralDiscount: (amount: number) => Math.min(walletBalance, amount)
});
```

### Signup Page Integration (NEW)
```typescript
// app/(auth)/register.tsx

// Form state includes referral code
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  fullName: '',
  email: '',
  phone: '',
  password: '',
  confirmPassword: '',
  referralCode: '',  // NEW: Optional referral code
});

// Validation for referral code
if (formData.referralCode.trim()) {
  const referralCode = formData.referralCode.trim().toUpperCase();
  // Format: Alphanumeric, 6-10 characters
  if (!/^[A-Z0-9]{6,10}$/.test(referralCode)) {
    newErrors.referralCode = 'Invalid referral code format';
  }
}

// Verify referral code with backend
const verifyReferralCode = async (code: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Check against database of valid codes
  const validCodes = ['SCRAP2024', 'REFER123', 'GREEN100', 'ECO2024'];
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  return validCodes.includes(code.toUpperCase());
};

// Registration flow with referral
const handleRegister = async () => {
  if (!validateForm()) return;
  
  setIsLoading(true);
  
  // Verify referral code if provided
  let referralBonus = 0;
  if (formData.referralCode.trim()) {
    const isValidReferral = await verifyReferralCode(formData.referralCode);
    
    if (!isValidReferral) {
      // Give user option to continue without code
      Alert.alert(
        'Invalid Referral Code',
        'The referral code you entered is invalid. Continue without it?',
        [
          { text: 'Continue Without Code', onPress: () => completeRegistration(0) },
          { text: 'Try Again', style: 'cancel' }
        ]
      );
      return;
    }
    referralBonus = 10; // ₹10 bonus for valid referral
  }
  
  await completeRegistration(referralBonus);
};

// Complete registration with bonus message
const completeRegistration = async (referralBonus: number) => {
  const successMessage = referralBonus > 0
    ? `Your account has been created successfully! You've earned ₹${referralBonus} referral bonus.`
    : 'Your account has been created successfully.';
  
  Alert.alert('Success!', successMessage, [
    { text: 'Sign In', onPress: () => router.replace('/(auth)/login') }
  ]);
};
```
